Google Tag Manager allows you track data for events like page views, clicks, and other user interaction through a GUI. It's easier than hard coding events to track and also has a good debugging tool which you can use before pushing to a production environment. 

Note: GTM provides Google Analytics data and so there is no need to include an additional GA script.
