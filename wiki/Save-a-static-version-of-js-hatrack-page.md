###Background

At the moment you can only see the contributors for a github repo via https://labhr.github.io/js-hatrack/ if you're logged into GitHub (because the information is pulled in real time to create the webpage and you need to be verified by GitHub to be allowed to send enough requests to compile the information). We'd like to host a page on the STEMM Role Models website that means ***anyone*** can see who has contributed without requiring the buy in of creating a GitHub account.

**Our solution:** A project member logs in with GitHub and create the lovely looking page via https://labhr.github.io/js-hatrack/ then saves a non-dynamic copy using the [Scrapbook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scrapbook/) Firefox add on.

###Instructions

* Install the [Scrapbook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scrapbook/) Firefox add on
* Create the Lets Build a Hat Rack contributors page for your project:
  * Go to https://labhr.github.io/js-hatrack/
  * Login with GitHub 
  * Enter the repository name
  * Click go!
* Save the page to your local machine using Scrapbook (click `alt` to see the Firefox browser menu). * Copy this folder (which is helpfully named with the date and time that you downloaded it) to your website's folder.

**And you're done!** :tada: :sparkles:
